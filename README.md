# Introduction

RF2Vec is an ongoing research project that tries to capture many important aspects of deep learning based radio frequency signal detection and classification:
* Applying neural networks to the problem of signal classification
* Leverage pre-trained models for transfer learning on signal classes not during training (transfer learning)
* Using machine learning to assign semanticly rich but compact fingerprints for signal similarity search

# TODO

* Research all the relevant papers and create a folder in this repo
* Locate or generate another signal databases (different types of signals) and perform transfer learning experiments 
* Create a custom signal generation and signal capture rig
