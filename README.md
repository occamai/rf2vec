# Introduction

RF2Vec is an ongoing research project that tries to capture many important aspects of deep learning based radio frequency signal detection and classification:
* Applying neural networks to the problem of signal classification
* Leverage pre-trained models for transfer learning on signal classes not during training (transfer learning)
* Using machine learning to assign semanticly rich but compact fingerprints for signal similarity search

# TODO

* Papers
  * Create a separate "papers" folder in this repo
  * Research papers that are relevant to this work and add to the folder
  * A good start is the references section of the paper
* Databases
  * Download relevant databases for this work
  * If they are too large, we need to use a Google/AWS Bucket
* Software to-vec Tools
  * What kind of tools are available that can convert RF to vec?
* Experiments
  * Transfer Learning ( pre-trained, fine-tuned on new signal type examples )
